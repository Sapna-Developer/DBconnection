For building NodeJS application TS is recommended.
//Framework follows MVC method. 
NodeJS is a library which helps to build serverless application.
NodeJS contain topic called ExpressJS which is framework and works for Rest Services such as GET, POST,PUT, HEAD, TRACE...etc.
ExpressJS plays role in development environment such as MEAN Stack/MERN Stack/MEVN Stack

NodeJS
=====================

🟠NodeJS is a server side scripting language.
🟠NodeJS used to develop servers.
-HTTP server
-TCP server
We will build Node Application in two ways.
-JavaScript
-TypeScript
JS is not object oriented.
JS doesn’t support OOPs concept
JS is an object based scripting language.
TS is the programming language, provided by microsoft and follows OOPs.

============================
Questions
1) Difference between object based and object oriented language.
==============================
 🟠NodeJS supports modules(libraries)
-predefined libraries and user defined libraries.

--------------------------------------------------
Modules
===============================
🟠1)http
-http module used to build http server.
🟠2)fs
-fs stands for file system
-fs module used to interact with the flat files[text files,xml files, json files]
🟠3)express
-express module used to develop the rest services[GET, POST, PUT, DELETE]
🟠4)mongoDB 
-mongoDB module is used to interact with the mongodb database without schema (rules and regulations).

🟠12)oradb
-used to interact with oracle database.
================================
🟠we will download all the above modules using “npm” or ”yarn”.
“npm” stands for node packaging manager.
“npm” present in nodeJS.
Synchronous | download modules one by one.
Asynchronous | download modules all at a time or parallely.
🟠“npm” is synchronous tool.
🟠“yarn” is a asynchronous.
🟠“yarn” given by facebook.
“yarn” tool is a asynchronous tool.

🗒Above modules downloads to “node_module” folders in current path.

============================
Questions
1) Which tool will take less time? Yarn.
2)Which tool consumes more bandwidth or internet? Yarn
3)Diff between mongodb and mongoose. 
mongodb[without schema] and mongodb[with schema]
=============================================
